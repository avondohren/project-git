Build a university admin system, which tracks teacher and student schedules - and student grades through multiple terms.

Don't worry about the look and feel of this. Just try to get a plan and working product built. Focus on the following non-technical skills:

1. Communicating effectively with everyone on your team. (Use Github to keep a centralized hub of information.)
2. Making sure everyone understands how the application is being built and feels involved.
3. Ensure everyone pushes code.
4. Once you get past the initial application setup, divide work so that you can get this finished quickly.

Choose a project manager for your group - or select one randomly. In addition to coding, they are responsible for the above non-technical goals being taken seriously by the group.
