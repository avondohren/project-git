Build a university admin system, which tracks teacher and student schedules - and student grades through multiple terms.

Don't worry about the look and feel of this. Just try to get a plan and working product built. Focus on the following non-technical skills:

1. Communicating effectively with everyone on your team. (Use Github to keep a centralized hub of information.)
2. Making sure everyone understands how the application is being built and feels involved.
3. Ensure everyone pushes code.
4. Once you get past the initial application setup, divide work so that you can get this finished quickly.

Choose a project manager for your group - or select one randomly. In addition to coding, they are responsible for the above non-technical goals being taken seriously by the group. They are also responsible for making sure the following technical processes are kept in mind:

- Each feature's work is on a different branch. (It helps to specify the branch in the Issue describing it - or even using the Issue number in the branch name.)
- Pull Requests are used to discuss work on a branch and eventually merge it.

Finally, the most important task for the project manager is to oversee **merge conflicts**. They should be responsible for merging branches together (e.g. when a Pull Request is ready to be approved). **When you resolve a merge conflict, you must do so with the branch's owner. Sit together (or screen share together) and resolve the conflict.**

Note: I strongly recommend spending a couple hours at the beginning getting everyone set up with [Join.me](https://join.me) or [ScreenHero](http://screenhero.com) - services which let you share your screen with other people. They have free trials.
